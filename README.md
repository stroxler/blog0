I've decided to start a blog, but I don't have a coherent
plan yet for how to keep the content - which is likely to
be mostly Rmd files and/or ipython notebooks - under version
control.

I'll be dumping all the source here, along with (hopefully)
enough notes to show how it all works, until I come up with
a better plan.
